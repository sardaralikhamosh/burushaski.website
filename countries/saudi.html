<b>Saudi Arabia,</b> officially Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, kingdom (1995 est. pop. 18,730,000), 829,995 sq mi (2,149,690 sq km), SW Asia, occupying most of the Arabian peninsula, bounded by 
Jordan, Iraq, and Kuwait (N), the Persian Gulf, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates (E), Yemen and Oman (S), and the Red Sea (W). Riyadh is the capital, Jidda the principal port.
Saudi Arabia has five major physical regions: the great Rub al-Khali, a sand desert occupying the entire south and southeast; the Nejd, a vast, barren plateau in the center; the Hejaz and
Asir, along the Red Sea, with mountains rising from an arid coastal plain; and the Eastern Province, along the Persian Gulf, site of the country's rich oil resources. The climate is usually
hot and dry, although the humidity along the coasts is high. Saudi Arabia has at least one quarter of the world's oil reserves, and the oil industry dominates the economy. Huge revenues
from oil exports have been used to diversify the industrial base; metals, chemicals, plastics, cement, and fertilizer are now produced. Irrigation projects have reclaimed many acres of 
desert, and grains, dates, citrus fruits, and vegetables are grown. Nomadic Bedouins raise camels, sheep, goats, and horses. Income is also derived from Muslim pilgrims who travel from
all parts of the world to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. The overwhelming majority of the population are Arabs who adhere to the Wahhabi sect of Islam, but 27% of the population 
consists of resident foreigners. Arabic is the official language.
<p>
<b>History</b><br>
Arabia has been inhabited for thousands of years by nomadic Semitic tribes. With the birth (AD 570) of Muhammad, in Mecca, Arabia was briefly the center of Islam, but by the end of the
7th	<br>centuary the area was disunited. Modern Saudi Arabia owes its existence to Ibn Saud, an adherent of the Wahhabi Muslim sect.
<p>
Beginning in 1902 he conquered the Nejd, Al Hasa, and Hejaz regions, and in 1932 he proclaimed himself king of a united Saudi Arabia.
<p>
Oil was discovered in 1936; commercial production began in 1938.
<p>
Ibn Saud died in 1953 and was succeeded by his eldest son, Saud.
<p>
In 1964 Saud was deposed by Faisal, who secured (1974) an agreement giving the Saudis a 60% majority ownership of foreign oil concessions in their country. 
<p>
In 1975 Faisal was assassinated; he was replaced by Khalid, who inaugurated a program of industrialization and social welfare. In the conflict with Israel, Saudi Arabia has generally 
supported the Arab states, although as a friend of the U.S. it is a somewhat moderating force. Its moderating influence has also been felt in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries (OPEC), in which it usually has acted to stabilize petroleum prices.
<p>
Khalid died in 1982 and was succeeded as king by Fahd. Military clashes, oil-policy disputes, and rioting Iranian pilgrims in Mecca led Saudi Arabia to sever diplomatic relations with Iran in 1989. 
<p>
In 1990 the kingdom joined the coalition that opposed Iraq's forcible annexation of Kuwait, and the forces of the coalition were largely based in N Saudi Arabia.
<p>
In 1992 King Fahd decreed a new constitution; among its features were an appointed national council (est. 1993) with the right to review, but not overrule, government acts. 
However, the royal family's power was basically undiminished. In the late 1990s, Crown Prince Abdullah, the king's half-brother and heir to the throne, effectively became the country's 
ruler due to King Fahd's poor health. Under the crown prince, the country has been more openly frustrated with and critical of U.S. support for Israel. A treaty with Yemen that ended 
border disputes dating to the 1930s was signed in 2000,	and early the next year both nations withdrew their troops from the border area in compliance with the pact. 
<p>
The Saudi government restricted the use of American bases in the country during the U.S.-led invasions of Afghanistan (2001) and Iraq (2003), and by Sept., 2003, all U.S. combat forces 
were withdrawn from the country. Also in 2003, the king issued a decree giving the Shura the authority to propose new laws without first seeking his permission. The move was perhaps
prompted in part by rare protests in favor of government reform; the kingdom also was shaken by violent incidents, including a massive car bomb attack against a residential compound in 
Riyadh, involving Islamic militants. Such terror attacks continued into 2005. 
<p>
The country held elections for municipal councils in Feb.&mdash;Apr., 2005, permitting voters (men only) to choose half the council members; the rest of the members were still appointed. 
<p>
King Fahd died in Aug., 2005, and was succeeded by Abdullah.
<p>
In Nov., 2009, fighting in N Yemen spilled over into Saudi Arabia when Yemeni Shiite rebels crossed the border. Saudi forces fought the rebels and sought to drive them back into Yemen and
away from the border; the conflict ended by Feb., 2010, with the rebels withdrawn into Yemen (and a truce established there).

<p>
In early 2011 Saudi Arabia experienced relatively small-scale antigovernment protests compared to other Arab nations, and those were at times harshly suppressed; many demonstrations 
involved Shiites. Protests and confrontations continued to a limited degree into 2012. Saudi forces also helped suppress antigovernment demonstrations in neighboring Bahrain. At the 
same time, the government lavished funds on government employee bonuses, low-income housing, and religious organizations. Later in the year, the king announced that women, who have had
limited civil rights in the country, would be allowed to participate in municipal elections after 2011 and would serve on the Consultative Council; in 2012 women were appointed to a fifth
of the Council seats.
<p>  
King Abdullah died in Jan., 2015, and was succeeded by Crown Prince Salman , his half brother. Saudi forces led Arab air attacks against Houthi rebels and their allies in Yemen after 
Yemen's president was forced to flee the country in Mar., 2015; there also were clashes along the Saudi-Yemen border. The execution of Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, a Shiite cleric, as part 
of mass execution of 47 condemned prisoners in Jan., 2016, was bitterly condemned by Iran; Saudi Arabia then broke off diplomatic relations with Iran.
<p>
In June, 2017, King Salman named his son Mohammed bin Salman crown prince, replacing his nephew and former heir apparent Mohammed bin Nayef. The king had previously appointed his son
defense minister and head of a council charged with overseeing the economy. Saudi Arabia, along with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Egypt, and a few other nations, broke diplomatic 
and	economic ties with Qatar in June, 2017, accusing it of supporting jihadi groups and destabilizing the region; Qatar rejected the nations' accusations and demandsand when tensions 
eased in Jan., 2021, the pre-2017 situation was largely restored as well. In November of 2017, an anticorruption drive led to the investigation of several hundred prominent Saudis, many 
of whom paid large settlements and were pardoned (while also remaining under government surveillance); the campaign also was seen in part as an attempt by Mohammed bin Salman, regarded 
as the country's de facto ruler, to consolidate his power. The country also sought that month to force Lebanon's prime minister, Saad Hariri, to resign, in a possible attempt to
discredit Hezbollah.   
<p>
The Oct., 2018, murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, led the Turkish government to denounce and discredit the Saudis repeatedly, as the
Saudis first denied that any killing had taken place and then several times changed their story concerning the killing before announcing arrests in the case. The murder provoked
 international outrage and damaged the reputation of the country and of Mohammed bin Salman. 
<p>
In Mar., 2020, the king's full brother and the former crown prince were arrested; the two were seen as potential rivals to the crown prince's succession.
