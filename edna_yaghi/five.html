Five…..<br>
Fifteen bullets came out from the beehive<br>
Stung me in the heart<br>
Left me with an endless wound in open air<br>
Five years and the pain is still there…<br>
<p>
“Give me a Five” the killer told his partner<br>
“We killed her….”<br>
Blood dripping from his smile<br>
“We killed her and killed her Five!”<br>
“Will they survive?”<br>
<p>
One husband and four children are still alive!<br>
Death was not an option after her death<br>
They had to tell her story to a world that is deaf:<br>
If sounds of bullets were not enough<br>
If screams of pain and anger<br>
Mocked by Israeli soldiers’ laughter<br>
Do not make the deaf hear<br>
Then we will etch our souls on hearts made of stone<br>
Hoping the marks will tell the story we want to tell<br>
About a saintly woman who rang the bell<br>
Against the oppression of Israeli hell<br>
<p>
Five is the number of fingers on her hand<br>
Each were pointing to the homeland<br>
Five her senses were:<br>
She saw the rainbow arching over our lives<br>
She smelled the wind of the Mediterranean<br>
She touched our souls with her kindness<br>
She tasted her food so that we can enjoy the taste<br>
She heard the voice coming from within and acted with grace<br>
But her sixth was the strongest: she knew! <br>
And her dreams & nightmares always came true!<br>
<p>
The Ten Commandments of Israel are now Five:<br>
Thou shall Kill, Kill, Kill, Kill, and Kill<br>
Palestinian blood thou shall spill, spill, spill, spill, and spill<br>
<p>
The Commandments of Shaden are now Five:<br>
Thou shall Love, Love, Love, Love, and Love<br>
Every year add more Love to my Love<br>
<p>
The followers of Shaden are now more than Five<br>
An army of lovers that shall strive<br>
To liberate Earth from oppression<br>
This is their sworn mission<br>
A war of attrition<br>
Israeli Apartheid will not survive<br>
<p>
Five Salaams on your soul<br>
Mama Shaden mother of all<br>
Mama Shaden mother of all…<br>
<p>
