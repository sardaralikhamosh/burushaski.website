Not enough tears on earth<br>
to wash away the blood<br>
Not enough blood on earth<br>
to wash away the pain<br>
Not enough faith on earth<br>
to take away my shame
<p>
Pain in my heart<br>
too hard to bear<br>
Shame in my heart<br>
for when I looked..<br>
My brother was not there
<p>
I held up my head in pride<br>
When the soldiers came <br>
They never broke the man inside<br>
Never flinched in pain, <br>
never gave up my pride<br>
I fought In Allah's name<br>
For justice I would have died
<p>
Couldn't you hear the cries<br>
Couldn't you feel the pain<br>
Didn't you realize<br>
The butcher was back again<br>
Fought a tank with a stone<br>
But never thought I'd fight alone
<p>
Pain in my heart<br>
too hard to bear<br>
Shame in my heart<br>
for when I looked..<br>
my brother was not there
<p>
Did you hear me call your name<br>
I tried to hold my ground<br>
But no one ever came<br>
No enemy cuts so deep<br>
As when brother watches brother<br>
slaughtered like a sheep
<p>
what no gun could ever do<br>
You have done to me<br>
I have lost much faith in you<br>
and my heart will never be<br>
whole or happy or healed<br>
Until Palestine is free<br>
Until Islam sees unity
