He was born to tell<br>
that Earth mustn’t be hell.<br>
Jesus The messenger of Peace<br>
walked the thorny path<br>
to end oppression
and impede human attrition…
 <p>
2010 years later<br>
oppression is still the norm<br>
and the lost Children of “Canaan”<br>
cannot go home<br>
prevented by a fascist terrorist state<br>
that calls itself “Israel”.
<p>
“Israel” is a hijacked name<br>
and smearing it with injustice is a shame.<br>
Israel is the title Allah gave to Jacob,<br>
a revered prophet and father of many prophets.<br>
But today “Israel” means bullets and rockets,<br>
blood and tears,<br>
and lives full of agony and fears.<br>
“Israel” is indeed a hijacked name<br>
and to stain it with genocide is a shame.<br>
Yet historical fallacy is accredited by Western diplomacy<br>
and the blessed name of a good prophet<br>
is now an Apartheid state<br>
and we have to accept this bloody fate<br>
and silently be ethnically cleansed<br>
and see our flesh with earth blend<br>
torn apart by bombs made<br>
in the USA<br>
called DIME<br>
while Europe pays<br>
in many ways<br>
for the continuation<br>
of this crime.
<p>
2010 years ago<br>
The Messenger of Peace was born<br>
to tell <br>
that Earth mustn’t be hell<br>
that love conquers all…
<p>
Today the birthplace of Jesus is surrounded by hate:<br>
Walls behind walls and gate after gate;<br>
To reach the city of nativity<br>
you must pass<br>
through humiliation<br>
turnstile<br>
and injure your soul<br>
mile after mile…<br>
Ugly soldiers will “look you with a scorn”<br>
and your whole being is torn;<br>
You are your ID<br>
A number<br>
A security threat<br>
Or benign existence<br>
But keep your distance<br>
From the barrel of the gun<br>
Any wrong move and you are gone…
<p>
The messenger of Peace 2010<br>
The People of Palestine<br>
Women and men<br>
Young and old<br>
The story must be told<br>
Truth we cannot bend:<br>
“Israel” is a lie<br>
On earth and in sky<br>
No more should die<br>
Apartheid must end.
<p>
Merry Christmas to all<br>
Including the children of Gaza,<br>
Nablus and Jenin…<br>
People who have conscience<br>
Know exactly what I mean!
<p><br><p>
 DIME is the "Dense Inert Metal Explosives" that were used heavily by Israel in its war on Gaza 2008-2009 resulting in the horrific deaths and injuries among Palestinian civilians.
