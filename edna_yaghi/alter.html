On the altar of love<br>
An angel came from above<br>
To take her soul away from all<br>
On a journey like that of prophets<br>
To the lands of the first call<br>
The home of martyrs and divine poets.
<p>
On that day Shaden didn't die<br>
And today, Feb 15, is her birthday<br>
Sixty six years of love, struggle, and tears<br>
For the children of Palestine<br>
And the earth that is yours and mine.
<p>
Sixty six years she is today<br>
Despite the pullets that killed her yesterday<br>
Or was it four years ago?<br>
A heart in love with her would not know<br>
Earthly time in this case does not show. 
<p>
In birthdays we give presents to those who we love<br>
But what present can you give to a person who is Love<br>
This is the greatest challenge of all<br>
Only divine help can prevent the fall.
<p>
A party for her I shall make<br>
The sweetest cake I shall bake<br>
Family and friends I invite<br>
Sixty six candles we must light<br>
A promise & oath we must make<br>
We will not stop the fight<br>
The chains of the oppressor we must break<br>
Peace and justice for children's sake.
<p>
