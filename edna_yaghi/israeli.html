I Am the Israeli
<p>
I am the focus of Palestinian fury<br>
I caused the Palestinian Diaspora and the exile<br>
I refuse to provide Palestinian travel documents<br>
And I deny the owners of the land I stole,<br>
Rightful possession of an ID card.
<p>
I imprison Palestinians without trial<br>
I beat and torture them<br>
I fear their anger, but envy their freedom<br>
For I am a slave of my passions.<br>
Though I am their jailer<br>
They enjoy more liberty than me,<br>
For their minds are free<br>
From the oppression I inflict on their bodies.<br>
<p>
I am the one who detains Palestinians<br>
Without their consent, in the absence<br>
Of a trial by law.
<p>
I am the Israeli soldier<br>
Shooting live bullets<br>
Into the hearts of my enemies.
<p>
Though I  kill their children<br>
Demolish their houses, <br>
And deport them,<br>
I envy their valiance, their spirit,<br>
Their resilience against my brutality.
<p>
I perpetrated the massacres at Deir Yassin,<br>
Sabra and Shatella,<br>
Tel el-Za'ter<br>
Al-Aqsa and El-Haram El-Ibrahami,<br>
Yet, they rise out of their own ashes<br>
Like the Phoenix bird and carry forward<br>
Their banners of courage<br>
Through their blood-stained streets.
<p>
I am the Zionist officer<br>
Slapping young Palestinian men across their faces<br>
I humiliate them at every crossroad,<br>
Every bypass, and every checkpoint<br>
But no matter how hard I try,<br>
I cannot take their identity away from them,<br>
Yet my own identity<br>
Slowly slips away into oblivion.
<p>
The incessant memory returning,<br>
The Palestinian of 48<br>
The Palestinian of 67<br>
The Palestinian of 98<br>
And the latest model of 2001,<br>
Haunt me.
<p>
I am the Occupier<br>
And the haunting insomnia is mine alone.<br>
I am the reason for the Intifada.
<p>
My armor bears the brunt of five hundred thousand<br>
Rocks hurled at me<br>
I quickly retaliate by shooting to kill<br>
The Gentile children,<br>
The infant Palestinian Davids.
<p>
I hear the Palestinian Dabkeh<br>
The wedding bells of newlyweds<br>
And I envy my enemies their<br>
Moments of silent dignified joy.
<p>
I am the cause of the endless funeral processions<br>
Of the Lion's sons, Palestinian Shibels.<br>
I am Pontius Pilate and Herod in one,<br>
Palestinian blood drips from my hands<br>
Its indelible red remains stamped <br>
Upon my memory forever.
<p>
I am Judas and every day is The Last Supper<br>
For those I lead to the slaughter.<br>
I am the Israeli fearing God's wrath<br>
And the reincarnation of Sodom and Gomorrah.
<p>
I am the new Hitler<br>
Out to slay the innocent<br>
All the while, losing my own humanity.<br>
I dwell in a state of perpetual denial of my own hideous crimes<br>
And refuse to recognize my savagery, my own brutality.<br>
<p>
I am the Israeli settler dancing around<br>
The dying young Palestinian I dragged<br>
Through the streets,<br>
I passed out candy<br>
And mutilated his body<br>
Even before his heart stopped beating,<br>
But I sold my soul to the devil in the process.
<p>
I am the cause of the Palestinian Holocaust.<br>
I have rewritten history so many times, I no longer know the truth,<br>
And I have hung so many heroes that I have lost count.
<p>
And though I feign superiority<br>
Over all non-Jews,<br>
I am not proud of what I am<br>
Or what I've done.<br>
I am the Israeli.<br>
