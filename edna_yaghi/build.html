Brothers and sisters, we now build Palestine. Open your ears and your mouths, because I have a loud word to say: We are building Palestine. Tell your friends and tell your foes that our land is Palestine. Our limbs can be broken, but our dream cannot be broken. Our freedom can be taken, but our pride cannot be taken. Our houses can be destroyed, but our memory cannot be destroyed. Our bodies can be killed, but our identity cannot be killed. We are humans when we treat others as humans, no matter how we are treated by others. 
<p>
Yes, my God, we have sinned to Thee. Yes, Lord, we have been surrounded by a raging army and we also sinned. We copied what we saw and learnt to give what we received. Thoughts of hatred and brutality we had built, as we lost family members and soil. But the Holocaust was not our fault. It was the fault of the Germans. We Palestinians were encouraged to hate and be violent, we were wanted to prove that we are the Untermenschen, and not the ones who wore that badge before. Dear Lord, have mercy on our souls and heal our wounds and the wounds of our enemies. 
<p>
Hear the news. We build Palestine, a country of real people. We unite now. We are not Israelis, we are not Jordanians, we are united Palestinians. See us on the internet pages of Mazen Hejleh here, he collected our names and institutions, so many names, so many institutions. We are not dead, and we will never be. 
<p>
When the Palestinian parties proclaimed their latest cease-fire they were rewarded with a bomb of one ton, thrown on Gaza children. The world was upset for almost a whole week, then it shook hands with Sharon again and said: isn’t it all relative? 
<p>
We are Palestinians and we ask God to not make us evil. No, no, we don’t want to be Israelis, and we don’t want to be Nazis. And we don’t have to be Israelis. Tell the 48ers to refuse the Israeli passport, because they are not Israelis, they are Palestinians. And tell the 67ers to not build Israeli houses while their own houses are destroyed by the IDF. Take a stand! Friends, what is stronger than violence? Do you know what is stronger than violence? I tell you, if you do not know, will you listen? Love is stronger than violence, did you ever hear this before? Did you ever believe this before? Did you ever understand this before? 
<p>
I say to you today, my friends, that in spite of the difficulties and frustrations of the moment, I still have a dream. I have a dream that one day this world will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: "We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal." When we let freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village. So put on your shoes and trust. Follow the path of love, it will hold you and make you strong, and your pain will cease. Support the activists. And unite. With all your love.
