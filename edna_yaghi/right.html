What is going on!! For God Sake!
<p>
A reminder for everybody, I cannot stop writing, I need to write about all what is happening.<br>
Three million people are prisoners now in Palestine; constant curfew is the life style they are leading, children cannot practice their minimum human rights of not becoming illiterates, schools are closed and no teaching anymore. Patients are not allowed to pass the checkpoints to arrive to hospitals. Doctors are now terrorists if they help an injured man or an injured woman. Houses are being demolished and more massacres happening everyday. 
<p>
What would Ariel Sharon expect from a frustrated teenager who has no hope in life, while maybe his family are half dead by now! This teenager is becoming a suicide bomber inside Israel; he is killing himself and others. (Called terrorist) by others, I call him a severe depressed person, who out of all the frustrations is acting abnormally towards himself and others. This is the disease of war, it will even spread more and more with ARIEL Sharon trying to suppress people with his continuous aggression on Palestinians.
<p>
History proved that occupation always had an end and a whole nation is able to beat inhuman governments by having the will and the belief in the nation's case. Palestinians will always fight until they get their human rights and be treated as humans on this earth.
<p>
It is time for Israel and for each descent JEW is this world to realize that they are not on top of others, being arrogant will not help the Israeli's.  Each and every Israeli in this world shall start thinking in a more democratic way, if you have the right to live then the Palestinian child has the right to eat, drink and live peacefully.
<p>Let us all put our hands together, all lovers of peace, let us fight non-democratic regimes and seek better lives for everybody. We shall all call for peace. Each and every one of us shall try to make a difference in his own way; it is our time to move forward!! We cannot stay silent in the middle of this bazaar.
