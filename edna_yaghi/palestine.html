Politicians are trying to create a new Palestine; to me nothing can be called Palestine without having all our rights back. But how can we have our rights back while Israel took the sea, the mountains and all of our shores!!! 
<p>
Sounds Radical I know!
<p>
I still remember my mother's home in Ramlah(Israel's territory now), my son still remembers Jerusalem(10 minutes from my home). <br>
Do you think it will be possible for the Palestinians to forget? I believe that even with the new aggression of Israel against us, even the ignorant of us are
becoming involved; it will take generations to forget.
<p>
My views are not my only thoughts; there are lots of people sharing the same.<br>
I believe that the new Palestine that will occur within the new defined territories by Israel and USA will create two problems! One is keeping the Zionist regime as safe as possible and even encouraging it to become stronger and stronger, while creating a big lie called Palestine on  a limited territory where Palestinians will always be jailed. 
<p>
Imagine this happening!<br>
Living together with Jews in one democratic state. It can happen; multicultural society and multi religion in one state do exist. Canada, USA, Australia are all good examples of multicultural societies.<br>
This is the only way for Palestinians to have rights back; accept each others culture and try to build a future for a country call it whatever you want (It can be called (the united Israel and Palestine)) for example!<br>
One government elected by everybody, real democracy and the right to live for everyone.<br>
Does this sound strange? I believe that this solution is even easier than separating the land into two states keeping all the feelings of hate and revenge from both sides.
<p>
I know that my thoughts are very radical, but it happened in South Africa, so why not in the Middle East. Humans can always live together given the opportunity to do so. African Americans are living peacefully now in a democratic state called USA, they can vote and choose their leaders!!!
<p>
Israeli's and Palestinians intellectuals shall start their battle, as without their interference extremism from both sides will rule us and we will never enjoy peace!
