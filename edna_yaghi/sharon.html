Whenever Palestinians are slaughtered, we do not hear US President George W. Bush speak out in anger against the bloodthirsty practices of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.
<p>
Today, several Palestinians were murdered, including Riham, a little schoolgirl only 10 years old. Riham died when Israeli soldiers shelled a school in the Al-Almaniya district in Jenin. Seven other girls were also seriously injured in the shelling. Riham and her schoolmates were not soldiers. They had no weapons. They were children attending school. Every child has the right to attend school and to not be a target of war.
<p>
Later on today, 3 Palestinian men from Fateh, were killed while on their way to give condolences to a friend. The car they were riding in exploded. They were the target of Israeli assassinators.
<p>
Sharon, the master terrorist, does not value the lives of Palestinian infants, children, or the civilian inhabitants of the remnants of Palestine. Intifada Al-Aqsa has provided Sharon with an excuse to lay siege to every Palestinian town, village and farmland as well as the indigenous inhabitants of the land.
<p>
For more than a year, Israeli gunboats, F-16 fighter jets, Apache helicopters, tanks, armored jeeps and bulldozers have been launching an all out war against a basically unarmed people. More than 700 Palestinians have died and another 20,000 have been injured. Many of these injured are children and many of these children will have to live the rest of their lives bearing permanent scars and impairments as a result of Sharon's war against them.
<p>
Homes have been bulldozed, farmland destroyed, olive and fruit trees uprooted, water supplies shut off or poisoned, electricity cut off, businesses have been sabotaged, schools shelled, school children critically hurt or killed, civilian areas bombed, and youths abducted, tortured and incarcerated. There is no justification whatsoever for these noble brave people to be so cruelly and barbarically treated. No one outside of Palestine stands up to the world and denounces the savage practices of a mad butcher who is intent on carrying out the genocide of the Palestinian people.
<p>
The world is ever silent to the atrocities committed against the Palestinian people who are forced to live in the ghettoes and concentration camps into which the Israelis have cornered them. Every Israeli endeavor, every day concentrates on how to humiliate, murder, maim and torture the Palestinian people simply because they are Palestinians living on their own land and because the Israelis want to take away what is left of Palestine. For 52 years, the Palestinian people have been the victims of Israeli aggression, occupation and lies.
<p>
Palestinians do not have warplanes, gunboats, tanks or helicopters that they use to attack their aggressors with. They are not given more than $5 billion dollars by the American government like the Israelis, nor are they armed with the latest and most sophisticated of American weapons. The only weapon most Palestinians have against the tyranny they are under is a stone thrown in the name of freedom.
<p>
The Palestinian people are surrounded by enemies who want to either drive them out of Palestine or to wipe them off the face of the earth. When in bitter frustration and despair Palestinians shot Israeli Cabinet Minister Rahavam Zeeve in retaliation for the extra judicial murder of Fateh Secretary-General Abu Ali Mustafa, the killing was immediately condemned by America. But when Abu Mustafa was murdered, no voice spoke out against the injustice and cruelty that is constantly practiced against the Palestinian people. And what about the life of little Riham? What sin was she guilty of? Why did she have to die? 
<p>
It is impossible for a people to be so abused, so tortured, so horribly mistreated and then expect them not to react. However, this is just exactly what Sharon wants. He wants to push the Palestinians into a corner, force them to fight back so he will have an excuse to kill more infants, more school children, more innocent civilians.
<p>
“We will carry out a war to the bitter end against the terrorists, those who help them and those who dispatch them,” Sharon declared as he accused the Palestine Authority of harboring “murderers.”
<p>
But the Master Terrorist is Sharon. He should wage a war against himself. He is the worst enemy of Israel and he already has the blood of 20,000 Lebanese and Palestinians on his hands when he commanded the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982.
<p>
But he should beware, for as long as he threatens the lives of Palestinian officials and as long as he insists on killing more and more Palestinians, he just might one day be cut down himself.
<p>
As long as Imperialists and Zionists support the terrorist policies of the war state of Israel, there will never be peace. Palestinians are entitled to a state of their own and they have the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. It is time this ethnic cleansing stopped. It is time the world deals with terrorism where it really exists.
