Day 6 -The outbreak of violence in Palestine erupted as a result of Ariel Sharon's intrusion into the Muslim sacred site of Haram Al-Sherif in Arab East Jerusalem. As of the time of this writing, more than 60 Palestinians have died on the sixth consecutive day of violence and thousands than have been injured.

<p>
Mostly unarmed civilian Palestinians in protest to the Israeli invasion of their sacred site fight with their bare hands or throw stones. Their stones are met with a storm of Israeli troops who fire anti-tank rockets, hand grenades and deploy combat helicopters.

President Jacques Chirac of France said of the escalating violence that, "You don't fight the emotions of a people with armored cars."  He also stated that such violence was a set back to the peace process and that the origin of the clashes was an "irresponsible provocation" caused by Ariel Sharon's visit to the Muslim holy site. This visit led to a "foreseeable explosion."
<p>
What is happening in Palestine right now proves many things. One is that the Palestinians have always been brave. But it is not lack of courage that might cause their losses, but rather that they are surrounded by the Israelis on one side and corrupt Arab leaders on the other.
<p>
Something else that has been proven countless times is that all Arab leaders raise armies for their own personal protection, not for the protection of their own people.  If anything, many Arab leaders protect the Israeli government as much as the Israelis themselves do.
Yet they feign concern whenever Palestinians are killed and rush to sterilized meetings filled with bouquets of flowers and bottled wines as if their pretense will stop the river of Palestinian blood flowing in the occupied land.
<p>
Though the Americans always misrepresent the news and always make Arab casualties less than they are and the circumstances of any conflict ambiguous, they never fail to make the Israelis less guilty than they continue to be.
<p>
However, Arabs blame everyone but themselves for what is happening in Palestine but the West will treat Arabs in such a way as long as the Arab leaders are corrupt and Arabs remain divided.
<p>
But it is not a shortage of Arabs and Muslim people who identify with the Palestinians and their suffering, but a case of corrupt Arab leaders who live off the flesh of their people and who want to keep the status quo so that they can continue to grow fatter from the American dollars that keep their bank accounts well padded.
<p>
Hilary Clinton is an actress on stage who does not seek a just solution to the ongoing loss of freedom, lives and land inflicted upon the Palestinian people but rather has become a turncoat to her very own sympathies before she began to run for senator of New York.  She has made sure that by criticizing the Palestinians and their struggle for freedom by saying that they should not receive any more money because they teach their children to hate, she will gain the Jewish vote in New York.   That infants such as little Sara Abdelhaq are killed by a hail of Israeli gunfire is of no importance to her. Hilary did not stay with her husband all through the Monica Lewinsky ordeal because of her noble character or out of the matrimonial commitment she made to her unfaithful husband, but because of the personal gains she could make by remaining the First Lady. She is a First Lady of Deceit in a country where morals have declined more in the last few years than in all of American history. Funny that she does not mention that Israelis should not receive any more of the billions of American dollars because of how they terrorize, brutalize, torture and massacre Palestinian civilians.

It is unique how Israelis take an incident that they began and are responsible for and turn it around to make it look as if they themselves were victimized.  But even Roni Daniel, a veteran Israeli television journalist had to remark when he saw the death of Rami Mohammed al-Durrah, (when cameramen for French television captured his death on tape) the 12 year old boy who crouched behind his father for protection when caught in the crossfire in Gaza, "I've been doing this for many years, and I'm not exactly a vegetarian. But my brain went dead and my tongue went limp. To see a little boy killed before your eyes…"
<p>
Only a true Islamic Jihad will deliver Jerusalem back to Muslims.  All of Palestine is sacred. Perhaps the butcher Ariel Sharon who has the blood of countless Palestinians on his hands has gone too far. No one has ever really forgotten the brutal role he played in the massacres of Sabra and Shatella during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982. He is not worth the lives of all who have died as a result of his arrogant and barbaric actions. But death, one day too, thou shalt die.
<p>
As for now, the Palestinians who live in the land of Palestine whether occupied by Jewish invaders in 1948 or 1967, are reenacting what Rafik Natsheh, the Palestinian labor minister said, "Our people are ready to have 10 times the numbers of martyrs, we gave too much to the peace process. We gave it to too much of a chance."
<p>
Until now, the Palestinians have stood alone in their defense of Muslim holy places in occupied Palestine. They are the ones who bleed for these Holy sites and they are the ones who die for them. But we must remember that the responsibility for protecting these shrines lies on the shoulders of every Muslim.
