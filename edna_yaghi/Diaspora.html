We, the Palestinians in Diaspora, wait desperately <br>
We wait for bits and pieces of news <br>
Of our people, our relatives, our land. <br>
CNN broadcasts a few pictures of dismembered limbs <br>
Of children crying, of an old bloodied woman <br> 
Lifted onto a stretcher. We hear sirens <br> 
We see bombed buildings and people running.
<p>
We are told as we clutch our TV screens <br>
That this new attack on the Palestinians <br>
Is the price to pay for a single rocket <br> 
Landing in the dirt of a new Israeli settlement  <br>
Built on our confiscated land. <br>
CNN labels defenseless Palestinians as terrorists <br>
Neglecting to mention that the real terror <br>
Is the F-16s dropping bombs on Palestinian civilians.
<p>
We, the Palestinians in the Diaspora, try to comprehend <br>
How Israelis equate justice and why the world is silent <br>
As the massacre of those locked away in Gaza continues: <br>
The enormous concentration camp turned mass prison <br>
The collective punishment of all simply because <br>
They bear the name of Palestinian.
<p>
It is not enough that without provocation <br> 
The Israelis steal Palestinian land <br>
Bulldoze their trees, tear down their houses? <br>
Is it not enough that they shut off the water supply? <br>
Is it not enough that Palestinians in Gaza have no food? <br>
They rain terror down on our people by air <br>
By land and by sea and then claim they are the victims.
<p>
We, the Palestinians in the Diaspora, wait for news <br>
Of our loved ones, praying for their safety, <br>
Praying for their survival, praying that the silent <br>
Indifferent world will wake up and hear the cries  <br>
Of the innocent. We pray that the world will <br>
Demand justice for Palestinians in Gaza. 
<p>
In our Diaspora, we flick the channels <br>
Hoping to hear more of the plight of Gazans <br>
On other newscasts. Instead we see Oprah <br>
Promoting the cause of homeless dogs <br>
We can’t make sense of it all,  <br>
Perhaps we do not understand <br>
A culture where a homeless dog lives <br>
 Better and safer than a Palestinian child
