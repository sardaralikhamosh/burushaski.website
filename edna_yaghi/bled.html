<b>
To whom this poet shall read,<br>
To whom shall he write?<br>
To you? To I who is always shy?<br>
To earth, to sky?<br>
To the living lie?<br>
To endless search for love lost?<br>
To minuets and hours inside the belly of the beast? To West or East?<br>
To friends who treaded this thorny path, bled and smiled and went away?<br>
To secrets hidden and revealed, to visions across this lonely field?<br>
To truth remaining after we die?
<p>
Ask not the bullets where they come from,<br>
Watch them weep in the air,<br>
They have seen his eyes, his smile, his hair.<br>
He was all of life? But life after he fell remained!<br>
Haunting those of us who silently watched. <br>
