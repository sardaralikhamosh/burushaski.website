<td> How?</td></tr> 
<tr>
<td>Argument:</td>
<td> The Palestinians missed their chance under Barak.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Counter-Argument:</td>
<td>Too bad!</td></tr> 
<tr>
<td>Argument:</td>
<td>As long as the Palestinians don't do this and that...</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>Argument:</td>
<td> There were innoscent Israelis killed.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Counter-Argument:</td>
<td>There were innoscent Palestinians killed.</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>Argument:</td>
<td>The Jews want to live without being dehumanized.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Counter-Argument:</td>
<td>Herzl didn't think much about the inhabitants of Palestine.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Argument:</td>
<td>The Jews were there before.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Counter-Argument:</td>
<td>Excuses.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Argument:</td>
<td> Like the city Meggido is one of the oldest cities in the world.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Counter-Argument:</td>
<td>Propaganda.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Argument:</td>
<td> The wailing wall and the temple... Jerusalem!</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>Counter-Argument:</td>
<td>So has the war.</td></tr>
<tr>

<tr>
<td>Counter-Argument:</td>
<td>So is the UN.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Argument:</td>
<td>You are being anti-Semitic.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Counter-Argument:</td>
<td>The Jews and the other peoples have the same rights.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Argument:</td>
<td>I don't like the way you say "Jews".</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Counter-Argument:</td>
<td>Sharon is known for decades to be idiotically violent.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Argument:</td>
<td>Israel must control the Palestinians. They want to destroy it.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Counter-Argument:</td>
<td> Fear.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Argument:</td>
<td>The suicide killers are also idiotically violent.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Counter-Argument:</td>
<td>So you think they are equal?</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Argument:</td>
<td>The Jews never want to be humiliated again.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Counter-Argument:</td>
<td>So they pass on the violence they received?</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Argument:</td>
<td>You are being...</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Counter-Argument:</td>
<td> ...anti-Semitic, I know. Why don't you call it anti-Zionist?</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Argument:</td>
<td>That's just as bad. Anti-Zionists are against Israel.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Counter-Argument:</td>
<td>Well, first, they are against Zionism.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Argument:</td>
<td>That is the same. Israel is in constant danger.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Counter-Argument:</td>
<td>Why is that so?</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Argument:</td>
<td>Because its enemies want to kill Israel.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Counter-Argument:</td>
<td>Why are they Israel's enemies?</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Argument:</td>
<td>Because they do not accept Israel.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Counter-Argument:</td>

<tr>
<td>Argument:</td>
<td>I have no idea.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Counter-Argument:</td>
<td>Why does Israel not comply with the UN resolutions?</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Argument:</td>
<td> Because the time is not ripe yet.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Counter-Argument:</td>
<td>The world politicians and media have a different view.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Argument:</td>
<td> They don't know the situation of the Israelis.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Counter-Argument:</td>
<td>And do the Israelis know the situation of the Palestinians?</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Argument:</td>
<td>It is their own fault.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Counter-Argument:</td>
<td>Isn't it racist what this state does to the Palestinians?</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Argument:</td>
<td>I will not talk on this level.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Counter-Argument:</td>
<td> Israel acts on this level.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Argument:</td>
<td> You are anti-Semitic.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Counter-Argument:</td>
<td>You already told me.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Argument:</td>
<td>I'm sorry, I cannot talk to you.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Counter-Argument:</td>
<td> Is there any remote possibility of guilt in Israel?</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Argument:</td>
<td>There couldn't be.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Counter-Argument:</td>
<td>Why is that?</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Argument:</td>
<td> Because nobody suffered like the Jews. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Counter-Argument:</td>
<td>You mean, I could not understand the Jews?</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Argument:</td>
<td> That's right.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Counter-Argument:</td>
<td> And do you take it into account to be understood?</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Argument:</td>
<td> Israel must do all this to show its strength.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Counter-Argument:</td>
<td>No more humiliation, right?</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Argument:</td>
<td> Back then we could not really fight for our rights.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Counter-Argument:</td>
<td>And now you can. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Argument:</td>
<td> Nobody can win over Israel, not even the black people.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Counter-Argument:</td>
<td>You mean the Indians.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Argument:</td>
<td>No, the Palestinians, of course.</td></tr>
