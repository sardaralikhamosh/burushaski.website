If I were President of the United States I would send Marines into Gaza to liberate the country.  There being no Israeli troops there, the most important intention would be to develop the psychological concept of Gaza as a real country who can invite whomever it pleases.
<p>
I would follow up by sending American or coalition troops into the West Bank (by Palestinian invitation, of course) to promote the same psychic-geopolitical notion there.  Israeli troops would not dare to fire on American troops -- geopolitical suicide.  
<p>
Coalition troops could open up the Israeli-only highway system to all (except perhaps one day a week when it would run only one-way: out), close all check-points and most of all tear up the titles to Israeli property (have a familiar ring? -- but here it may be time to dicker, see below) and move all Israeli military out without a shot being fired...
<p>
...all of which should make continued residence just too uncomfortable for the great majority of Israeli settlers -- without so much as breathing a word in their direction.
<p>
I don't believe that Palestinians would harm a hair on Israeli settlers' heads -- at least, at first; while waiting on a negotiated shake-out.  I take the Palestinians to be the easiest people on earth to get along with -- after ever mounting Israeli abuse all they seem to ask is to be left alone.  I suspect the Irish would have stormed Tel Aviv, by now, swinging broom sticks if that were all they could lay their hands on, if they had been subject a tenth of the same abuse (authority: I have 5 Irish grandparents counting my mother's step-mother).
<p>
How hard would it be for settlers to move back to Israel?  How hard was it to move to the West Bank in the first place -- how hard would it be to move to Brooklyn?  Moving would be much cheaper in the long run than maintaining as many tanks on short notice as Western NATO and the US armies combined -- on 1% of the population base -- and should be infinitely less costly to the Western liberal psyche.
<p>
The settlers might not have to clear out -- as long as the Palestinians maintain complete sovereignty and control.  
<p>
Seem a shame to waste all that expensive settlement real estate that Palestinians might not even be able to afford to keep up -- when both sides might profit.  Perhaps the poorer Palestinians could lease the settlements back to the richer Israelis; maybe not even to the same Israelis; maybe to any comers; all the market will bear (and sell the Israelis the water resources they have been raiding, too)!  Could mean a humongous amount of money in third world terms for Palestinians and hopefully not too much for richer first world Israelis to afford (hey; this is the Middle East, you bargain) -- all hinging on the Palestinians maintaining absolute control, of course.
