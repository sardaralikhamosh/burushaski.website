My Beloved,
<p>
18,934,560 Minutes have passed since Sindbad started his worldly journey.
<p>
Sindbad did not reach his destination yet.<br>
Sometimes he feels that he never left.<br>
How many faces he met?<br>
How many choices he made? How many bets he bet?<br>
How many times was he caught in the enemy’s net?<br>
How many times he won? How many times he lost?<br>
How many candles he extinguished? How may candles he lit?<br>
How many times they tried to convince him to take his rest?<br>
How many times they told him to abandon his ship and build a palace like the rest?<br>
How many times they told him: sell your soul and you will be the best?<br>
How many times they told him: think of yourself and forget the rest?
<p>
My beloved,
<p>
For you I travel, your face I seek.<br>
Your heart is my sea, your breath my wind;<br>
Your eyes my gate to my soul.
<p>
For you I travel, your face I seek.<br>
In you all journeys end; from you all journeys start.
<p>
Have I lost the blessing of your secret?
<p>
<br>
<p>
((315,576 Hours))
<p>
315,576 hours of searching for the unknown<br>
I searched for you in you but I did not find you<br>
I searched for me in you but I did not find me<br>
I did not find you at the end of the road &<br>
I did not find you at the beginning of the road . . .<br>
But how and when did we meet?
<p>
I searched for your eyes everywhere<br>
In the deserts of life<br>
In the sea<br>
On the train . . .<br>
Inside my soul<br>
"All in all, it is just another brick in the wall" . . .
<p>
But Sindbad is made to transcend all walls . . .<br>
And, again, as my dear Bob Marley said:<br>
"Emancipate yourself from mental slavery,<br>
Non but ourselves can free our minds" . . .
<p>
So, 315,576 hours of searching . . .<br>
And the search continues ----------- <br>
Despite the curfew, the guns and tanks, the barbwires, and betrayal…!<br>
