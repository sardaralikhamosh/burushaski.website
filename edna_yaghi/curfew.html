Sixty five days and counting,<br>
Anger in my being is mounting.
<p>
Sixty five days and counting,<br>
The child in me is shouting:<br>
I want to run, to fly, to sing, to cry,<br>
To walk, talk, write on the blackboard with a chalk:<br>
"End this bloody occupation..."
<p>
Sixty five days and counting,<br>
Nablus the city of goodness,<br>
A wounded witness to this “bloody occupation...”
<p>
No need for wake up calls,<br>
The tanks come on time,<br>
Go on time,<br>
And leave you no time to plan your time…<br>
But can these tanks kill the thyme… of Ebal and Jirzim?
<p>
Kneel to these monsters they tell us everyday,<br>
But only to Allah we kneel when we pray,<br>
Another sixty five thousand days will not change what I say.
<p>
Tanks do not grow on mountains but olives do.<br>
Tanks do not grow on mountains but Palestinians do.<br>
I am an olive and my blood is oil,<br>
My flesh is this sacred soil,<br>
My breath the wind of the Mediterranean,<br>
My eyes make the sea blue.
<p>
Sixty five days and the fascist can go to hell,<br>
The mosque will say Allah Akbar,<br>
The Church will ring its bell. <br>
