The EU and the USA have suspended the transfer of subsidies for Palestine. It could be derived from the media that this act is meant to be a punishment of the Palestinian society for having voted for the wrong party. The West did want these elections to be democratic, but under the condition that a certain party wins. Hamas, who won the elections, is reproached with three issues: that it does not acknowledge Israel's right of existence, that it does not renounce violence, and that it does not keep existing contracts. 
<p>
Isn't this cynical, one could object, as these three items characterize the Jewish State much better than the Palestinian side: Israel has never acknowledged the right of existence of the indigenous population. Israel has never renounced violence, either. On the contrary, it is gloating about its "targeted killings" and its continuous military attacks. Israel, thirdly, does not keep contracts and UN resolutions, but makes unilateral decisions by principle. The Palestinians neither have the same rights, nor a state or an army, nor a decent infra-structure. Therefore the way the Palestinians behave is almost irrelevant, for the power for change is not in their hands. 
<p>
Beyond doubt, the invocation of Israel's right of existence is immediately connected with the genocide of the Jews committed by Germans and Europeans. Behind the demands addressed to Hamas there is the notion of "Never again Hitler" which before had been ascribed to Fatah. Thus Palestinians are not assessed according to Palestinian history, but according to German and Jewish history. 
<p>
Still many Palestinians ask themselves how Germany of all countries can so unconditionally support a state which is ruling with the power of weapons, which is practising a dubious segregation of races, pursueing a blood-and-soil ideology, creating rightless subhumans, taking living space in the East and a state that does not care for the human rights and international law, as it considers itself as being racially and/or religiously superior, compared with other states. 
<p>
One has to be aware of the fact that the Nazi history has not sufficiently been digested and a mindset of stereotypes still prevails according to which there are inherently good and evil peoples and societies. The German public until today is unable to conceptualize Jews in non-racist terms. If they are not the evil guys they are the good guys and their opponents are the evil guys. There is no other way to explain the absurd behavior towards the Palestinians. 
<p>
When one searches for the Nazi evil in the Palestinians one does not have to search for it in the own past and present. Analogously, in the current immigration debate those humanist values, that Germany is unable to fulfil, are projected to measure "the other", distracting from the own behavior. Psychologically, this is the - failing - attempt to chip evil, so that it will not stand in one context with the own identity. 
<p>
Only the cast of the roles has changed. The ideology and the mechanisms, which had led to the genocide of the Jews in the West, are valid like before. On the contemporary level, certainly, there are no gas chambers employed anymore. This is the only way to keep the Jewish western trauma working, by continuously inflicting it in an unreflected way upon originally uninvolved parties. We cannot change this now. But we can explain it.
