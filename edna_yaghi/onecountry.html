Someday leaders in Israel / Palestine will arise that respect the 10 commandments of Moses and a constructive peace formula will replace destructive bombs. There is a political peace formula repeated in history that ends war and wins the peace called a Federation of States. 
<p>
Politically a federal democracy requires the three levels of government found in the time tested western democracies. Firstly a local municipal level of government, secondly very separate state levels of governments and last but not least a federal level with 50%-50% equal representation from each State so no side ever in power. 
<p>
The seed for a federation of States can be planted when state leaders agree to form a committee to overlap any state power like tourism, trade, infrastructure, development, education or public health to start with, so the fruits of co-existence can be seen on the ground and take root. 
<p>
Since the Holy Land is so small the only way to guarantee no more fighting over borders is to share maximized borders. This means the state borders of the state of Israel and state of Palestine are also the healing federal borders of Palestine / Israel being from the Mediterranean Sea to Jordan, from Egypt to Lebanon and Syria. 
<p>
The shared capital of the State of Israel and the State of Palestine is Jerusalem. In Canada the French, English and Natives all share the capital of Ottawa. Also Washington DC is the shared capital of the United States of America. After the civil war the former slave states and the non slave states also adopted One country with States. The USA also share maximized borders and states contribute to a higher level of co-operation called a federal government. 
<p>
The Torah, the Bible and the Koran all agree Jerusalem is the undivided capital and they agree on the Holy Land borders but like children they must learn to share. For election purposes the cities can have municipalities. Towns and cities can have both an Arabic name and a Hebrew name. 
<p>
Each municipality can be classified to be either an Arabic municipality, a Hebrew municipality or both a Hebrew and Arabic mixed municipality. Each municipality by it's language classification elects politicians to either the State of Israel legislature or the State of Palestine legislature. A mixed municipality can elect politicians to both State of Israel and to the State of Palestine as long as the state wants to add a seat for them. 
<p>
A federal constitution can guarantee that the State of Israel's government would always be conducted only in Hebrew and the state of Israel would have only Hebrew speaking members even if a billion Arabic speaking people immigrated to, returned or are born in Palestine / Israel. For Example here in Canada the province/state legislature of Quebec will always be conducted in French even if 20 million English speakers move in to Quebec. French is guaranteed in the federal law book of Canada. 
<p>
The two state governments are to be conducted in two different languages with two different flags and different anthems but the new federal level will soon need a parliament building which should be built on common ground near the capital of Jerusalem. The federal level of co-operation will have no leader and a multi-lingual non voting speaker of the house. 
<p>
A Federal constitution would allow all citizens to live and work anywhere in the country they choose protected by one agreed on highest federal law. Federal democracies enjoy free trade between states, they share a common currency and they have an integrated army. I propose in Israel / Palestine for the tourism's sake have an one integrated English speaking police force under the control of the countries one integrated military. 
<p>
The two state supporters do not realize the western concept of "OK let's split it" and just dividing the baby Holy Land will not bring peace. Would the French in Canada except just Quebec or Indians scattered reservations if they did not enjoy city, state and federal equal citizenship rights as well. The one state supporters know the spiritual benefits of one law in one land but they do not realize Israel thinks an Arabic majority in one state would try to kill them making one state as it stands a non starter and might not happen. In a winner take all democracy based on population language demographics the current one state plan would encourage killing off the other side to have control. The only formula that has no down side is a federation of states at maximum borders which combines the benefits of both the one state plan and the two state plan and will end this war.
