What if America supported a China that crisscrossed Tibet, up and down, with Chinese-only roads which Tibetans were neither permitted to travel upon nor to even cross over without queuing to Chinese checkpoints: effectively fracturing Tibet into a 100 little cantonments?
<p>
Suppose America backed a China that inundated Tibet with settlers that had grown to 20% of the population – which settlers, distained vacant land in favor of evicting natives from ancient family homes even as they appropriated Tibet’s choicest land and water resources for themselves?
<p>
What if – reminiscent of the Taliban shooting women for “religious offenses” – American armed Chinese troops habitually shot Tibetan children for throwing rocks?
<p>
If -- all of the above -- we might, today, be ducking Buddhist fundamentalist terrorists.  What most Americans don’t get about Islamic terrorists is that they are not Red Brigades types who hate our way of life (they willingly accept “infidel” cash for oil) – rather what America is engaged in with in these fanatics is the latest Arab-Israeli war which, this time, we have taken the immoral part of.
<p>
In the first four such wars, 1947, 1956, 1967 and 1973 Arabs attempted to push Israel into the sea – but after 1973 Egypt and Jordan abandoned that hope; and lone Syria could no way face Israel’s war machine.  
<p>
Today’s clash is rooted in the 1967 war (overlapping Israel’s 1973 self-defense and its 1982 invasion of Lebanon), after which Israel began a population offensive, urging Jews from all the world to come settle the newly captured territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip – squeezing West Bank natives into neighboring sands, so to speak. 
<p>
Ariel Sharon has made a career of asserting that “Egypt is a Palestinian state” and “Jordan is a Palestinian state” – the implication being, that if native Palestinians don’t like Israel making living space for the Jewish people out of their homeland, they are free to take their leave.
<p>
The Palestinians have not taken the hint – nor have a billion plus Islamic friends -- one result: America has traded now skyscrapers for settlements.
<p>
Thomas Friedman of the New York Times bemoans Arafat’s supposedly missed opportunity to accept 94% of the land he wanted in exchange for permanent peace.  But, who could reasonably expect Palestinians or any self-respecting people to endure 20% of their population being left-behind invaders – especially when the left-behinds must necessarily be running their homeland – or how could anyone expect native Palestinians to go on living their demeaning separate and very unequal existence?
<p>
My advice to Palestinians and their militant cohorts is to stop blowing up their own children and other people’s children in Pizza shops and stop dreaming about bombing buildings in downtown New York City.  Madison Avenue is potentially mightier than the Islamic – or Israeli – sword -- especially when Israel’s friends don’t seem to have a clue what the Islamic sword is so worked up over.
<p>
America has reliably kept Israel from being pushed into the sea over the decades.  It is not our job to finance and arm Israel’s version of “manifest destiny”.
<p>
How practicable to evict settlers?  George Wallace was probably the most intransigent American political fanatic of the twentieth century: the most rigid opponent of racial integration.  Yet, even he admitted “We were wrong” once the issue had been irretrievably decided against him.  
<p>
Once Israeli injustice (an especially sad story for Christians, too, who see our own deep roots in Israel) is understood far and wide, the majority of settlers will likely cave – a civilized people should be vulnerable to world-wide shame (unfortunately reminds me of residents of German towns being forced to face the facts of nearby concentration camps at the end WWII).  Which should leave remaining settlers in that much more untenable a social position: causing more to quit.  Hopefully, the last holdouts will be small enough in number to be manageable no matter how implacable.
<p>
Some Arabs will always wish to push Israel into the sea.  But, once the West Bank is free, the terrorist recruiting pool will be tens times smaller and potential recruits ten times less heated.  It could then be time for the Islamic worst to do their “George Wallace”.  Only when Palestinians are safely out from under Israel’s impossible dream will the end of the last Arab-Israeli war be possible.
