Staying at home for 46 days is a great opportunity for somebody who used to work for the whole year, travel around the world, and be exhausted from meeting people.
<p>
But it is something else for us, We did not work at all for past few months, we did not even leave our city. I myself did not see any scene of the countryside and its green trees. I used to see the destroyed dusty streets of Nablus City, and the unemployed people around.
<p>
What you can do if you were forced to stay in your flat for such a long time? You don't have the right to sit on the balcony; you might be shot if you dare to do that.
<p>
The son of our neighbor, Mahmud Al-Shafi`i, 3 years old was shot yesterday while he was sitting on the balcony. He got injured; he had to wait for the ambulance for half an hour.
<p>
I have made up my mind to use the curfew time in doing some useful things, I have done a lot on the computer, like the orphan girls' house data, the Women Union Modernization Project, the Uprising cartoons, the Mideast cartoons, Flash course, TOEFL training course, cleaning the flat, calling all of my friends, and the friends of my friends, reading a book about "My Antonia" to Willa Cather, some other philosophy articles, as well as watching TV programs, which are normally interesting, but this time I feel they are boring. I did talk on mobile and phone for few thousands minutes. But the mood goes from bad to worse.
<p>
I did notice that I am getting worse, my psychological mood becomes bad, I don't have the desire for food, I am also losing the need of combing my hair or even shaving my beard. I wish I can go outdoors, and ride my bicycle, Oh there are no more suitable streets for bikes!!
<p>
This frustrating atmosphere had been increased when an Israeli tank destroyed the electricity provider in front of our house, electricity were cut of for a day. There is no more computer, nor TV, neither some music or even mobile charger. 
<p>
Luckily, the municipality managed to provide us with electricity once again, so, I am back.
<p>
I wish I can close my eyes and open them, to see that this nightmare goes to its end, I am dreaming about visiting Birzeit University and Ramallah, I miss them that much. I see them in my dreams, what a strange life! In the past, I was dreaming about revisit Damascus, where I have had the romantic age of my life, then, I was dreaming about Amman, which is sooooooo far at he moment. Then, I have this dream: Ramallah and Birzeit, where I have left great friends, and part of me still there.
<p>
If such realistic dreams could not be approached, How I can continue dreaming about Al-Andalus and Yafa!!!
<p>
Sorry to Gabriel Garcia Markiz, I quote the " In Curfew Age" from his Novel: " Love in Cholera Age". I hope he can come from Latin America to my country, where he can write a new novel, which might be called: "Love in Curfew Age" or:" Love in Siege Age". It will be amazing, we have many many stories, which could be the material of such novel. 
What do you think!
