After a long day on the Allenby Bridge going from Jordan to Palestine , and as a Palestinian I am forced by Israel to go through special borders only for Palestinians and probably some animals who can survive hardship ( Of course all borders are under the control of the Israeli Government). Birds, cats and dogs can cross the bridge through the other borders were all the Israelis, tourists, human beings enter Israel.
<p>
At that day I remembered my childhood as I was living in my small town Beit Jala near Bethlehem and we used to cross the borders to Jordan to meet our relatives, this was thirty years ago where the Israeli Army at the borders used to strip us and take of our clothes and shoes and throw them in big rooms in the name of security, while emptying our bags from clothes and checking each underwear to make sure that a seven year old girl does not have any bombs inside her Pajamas!!!! I always wondered! why they did not use the security machines instead of all this? I was only seven years old and did not understand what racism and humiliation and occupation and segregation and ethnic cleansing and apartheid mean (You can choose whatever word or any combination you want and it will just suit the case. ).
<p>
All those memories just came back to me that day, wow, there has been some improvement! they do not strip us anymore, they use machines to check us! well, my smile did not last long as the soldiers are still there practicing emotional and psychological abuse and implementing a bitter treatment policy that makes you just feel angry, of course one of those soldiers was a Jewish Ethiopian who came newly to Israel and has the full right to enjoy her Israeli citizenship and freedom while taught to humiliate and shout at the Palestinians travelers. I was patient enough to take her shouting but how can you control your temper after waiting more than seven hours under the sun and then going through Bus that stops at the checkpoints for hours to be able to cross the borders ( The Israeli side give us certain hours to travel and only allows a certain number of Buses to enter everyday!) , we shall not forget the way our bags are still treated! 
<p>
Finally after a long day I crossed the borders to go to Bethlehem.As a Palestinian I am not allowed to cross Jerusalem in order to arrive to my town which is just seven Miles from Jerusalem, I will need to go through a very primitive road only done for the Palestinians and Donkeys with all the steep hills and mountains and uncomfortable pavements to reach Bethlehem. A very difficult road that goes around Jerusalem and is called the Hell Vally or Wadi Elnar!!
<p>
Wow! I am almost near Bethlehem,  the nice view of the 25 feet wall on my right side was adding to the excitement!!, I finally arrive Bethlehem, the wall in that part looked like a snake shape and there are houses between the walls, how dare they build houses in between walls!!!!what kind of people are those?!!!
<p>
finally I arrive to Beit Jala where almost no land is kept for Palestinians, and my parents house has a nice view of the wall!!!!!!
<p>
I then started to contact my friends, some of them were in prison for a long time when we were children, they went to prison just because they wanted to be free, currently they are not living in my small town, they have been slowly evacuated by the occupation and ended up living everywhere in this world. my Two other friends who are still surviving there, started to tell me about there daily sufferings, they are in a big prison, the prison is around 3 square miles  were they are allowed to move , otherwise they will need to go through gates that open only for people who have special permits to pass those gates, Of course the special permit is not easily given, you have to have a good excuse to pass, such as, you should be suffering from a cancer disease and you need to be treated in proper hospitals ,and even with such an excuse you may not get the permit and left to die peacefully in your beloved Holy Land!!
<p>
This is just a view for my last visit to my home town, which made me open my eyes even more and more, and for those who defend the wall accusing us as terrorists and justifying the existence of Injustice as part of their security plan, should go and try to live inside those concentration camps and tell us about their experience. Not to forget that this wall is built on a Palestinian Land within the 1967 borders  were Israel made sure to capture all the water reservoirs ( of course as a security excuse!!! )so that Israel will enjoy the water that the Palestinians should own!!
